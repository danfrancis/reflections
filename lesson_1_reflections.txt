How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It enabled me to quickly identify which lines had changed in the file, so
    I could focus my search.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It could held me more easily identify bugs and revert to old states if needed.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro: Each commit is likely to be meaningful & appropriately sized
    Con: User error - may forget to commit appropriately or frequently enough

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because multiple files are more tightly related in software vs. other use cases.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log: See previous commits, including ids and comments
    git diff: See the changes made between commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I know I can easily revert to an earlier state if I make a mistake.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Creating and managing future software projects
